A permutation is a rearrangement of the elements in an ordered collection. It
is a one-to-one mapping—a bijection—and therefore reversible.
[Lehmer codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_code) provide a mapping
between positive integers and permutations, which make it possible to describe
a permutation of _n_ elements in _O(nlog(n))_ space. __Metamorphose__  provides
an implementation of this encoding.
